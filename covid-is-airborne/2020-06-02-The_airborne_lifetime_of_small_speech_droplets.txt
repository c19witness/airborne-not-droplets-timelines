text_headline: The airborne lifetime of small speech droplets
text_text: We estimate that 1 min of loud speaking generates at least 1,000 virion-containing droplet nuclei that remain airborne for more than 8 min. These therefore could be inhaled by others and, according to independent action hypothesis, trigger a new SARS-CoV-2 infection.
