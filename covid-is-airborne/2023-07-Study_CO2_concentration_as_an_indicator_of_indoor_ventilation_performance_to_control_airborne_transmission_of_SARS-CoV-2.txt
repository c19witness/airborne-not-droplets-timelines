text_headline: Study: CO2 concentration as an indicator of indoor ventilation performance to control airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2
text_text: Conclusion: Given the conditions of the occupancy environment, it is possible to determine an indoor CO2 concentration threshold, and keeping the CO2 concentration lower than a certain threshold could help reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection.
