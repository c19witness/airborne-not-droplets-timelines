text_headline: Exhaled CO2 as a COVID-19 Infection Risk Proxy for Different Indoor Environments and Activities
text_text: "Indoor CO2 measurements by low-cost sensors hold promise for mass monitoring of indoor aerosol transmission risk for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. We derive analytical expressions of CO2-based risk proxies and apply them to various typical indoor environments.."
