text_headline: Article: Japan has long accepted COVID's airborne spread
text_text: Article: 'If the WHO recognizes what we did in Japan, then maybe in other parts of the world, they will change (their antiviral procedures),' said Shin-Ichi Tanabe, a professor in the architecture department of Japan's prestigious Waseda University.
