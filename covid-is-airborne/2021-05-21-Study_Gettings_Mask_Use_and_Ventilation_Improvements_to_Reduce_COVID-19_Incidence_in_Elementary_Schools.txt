text_headline: Study: Gettings. Mask Use and Ventilation Improvements to Reduce COVID-19 Incidence in Elementary Schools
text_text: "COVID-19 incidence was 37% lower in schools that required teachers and staff members to use masks and 39% lower in schools that improved ventilation. Ventilation strategies associated with lower school incidence included dilution methods alone (35% lower incidence) or in combination with filtration methods (48% lower incidence)."
