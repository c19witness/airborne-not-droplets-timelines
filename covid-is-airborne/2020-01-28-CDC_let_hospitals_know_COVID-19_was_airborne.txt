text_headline: CDC let hospitals know COVID-19 was airborne
text_text: "Use respiratory protection (i.e., a respirator) that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator..." and "Standard practice for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g. measles, tuberculosis) is to restrict unprotected individuals, including HCP, from entering a vacated room sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles".
