text_headline: 13 year old kid spreads it to 11 more in family
text_text: Index case was 13 y.o. Spread to 11 more. [ed: kids transmit]. Twelve of the 14 who stayed INSIDE at the house (sleeping there) caught it. Six who came to the house, but remained distant outdoors did NOT. [ed: one more for indoor = bad, outdoor = good]. Via <a href='https://x.com/jmcrookston/status/1313281284249182208'>@jmcrookston</a>
