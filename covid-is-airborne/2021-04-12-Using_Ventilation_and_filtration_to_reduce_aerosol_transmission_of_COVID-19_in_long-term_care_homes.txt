text_headline: Using Ventilation and filtration to reduce aerosol transmission of COVID-19 in long-term care homes
text_text: "In Canada and worldwide, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected residents and staff in long-term care homes (LTCH). Interim guidance on infection prevention and control (IPC) for COVID-19 within LTCHs has been developed to protect LTCH staff and residents. The following guidance on ventilation aims to potentially reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission within LTCHs and, should be used jointly with the LTCH IPC guidance, not as a replacement."
