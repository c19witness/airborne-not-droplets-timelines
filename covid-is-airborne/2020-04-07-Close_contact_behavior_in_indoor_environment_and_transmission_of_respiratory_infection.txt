text_headline: Close contact behavior in indoor environment and transmission of respiratory infection
text_text: "We propose the existence of three sub-routes of transmission: short‚Äêrange airborne, large droplets, and immediate body-surface contact. We also distinguish a "body contact," which is defined with an interpersonal distance of zero, from a close contact. We demonstrate herein that the short-range airborne sub-route may be most common."
