text_headline: Study: Heterogeneity in transmissibility and shedding SARS-CoV-2 via droplets and aerosols
text_text: For some emerging infectious diseases, including COVID-19, few cases cause most secondary infections. We analyze the distribution and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 rVL, including across age and symptomatology subgroups.
