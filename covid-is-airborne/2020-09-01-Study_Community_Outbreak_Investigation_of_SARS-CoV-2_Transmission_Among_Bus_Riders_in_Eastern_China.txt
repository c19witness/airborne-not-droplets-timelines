text_headline: Study: Community Outbreak Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Among Bus Riders in Eastern China
text_text: "In this cohort study of 128 individuals who rode 1 of 2 buses and attended a worship event in Eastern China, those who rode a bus with air recirculation and with a patient with COVID-19 had an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those who rode a different bus. Airborne transmission may partially explain the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among these bus riders."
