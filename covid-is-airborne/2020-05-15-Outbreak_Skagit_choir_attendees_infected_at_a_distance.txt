text_headline: Outbreak: Skagit choir attendees infected at a distance
text_text: Following a 2.5-hour choir practice attended by 61 people, including a symptomatic index patient, 32 confirmed and 20 probable secondary COVID-19 cases occurred (attack rate = 53.3% to 86.7%); three patients were hospitalized, and two died. Transmission was likely facilitated by close proximity (within 6 feet for some) during practice and augmented by the act of singing. Reported in: <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e6.htm'>CDC Journal May 15, 2020</a> as well as a <a href='https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/7/10/ofaa430/5905033'>larger study that was available much later in September</a>.
