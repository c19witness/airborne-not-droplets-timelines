text_headline: Study: Nosocomial outbreak of COVID-19 by possible airborne transmission leading to a superspreading event
text_text: "Conclusion: This nosocomial point source superspreading due to possible airborne transmission demonstrated the need for stringent SARS-CoV-2 screening at admission to healthcare facilities and better architectural design of the ventilation system to prevent such outbreaks. Portable high-efficiency particulate filters were installed in each cubicle to improve ventilation before resumption of clinical service."
