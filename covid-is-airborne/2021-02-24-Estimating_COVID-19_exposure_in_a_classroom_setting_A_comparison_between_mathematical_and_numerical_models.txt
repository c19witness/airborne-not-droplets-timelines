text_headline: Estimating COVID-19 exposure in a classroom setting: A comparison between mathematical and numerical models
text_text: "The COVID-19 pandemic has driven numerous studies of airborne-driven transmission risk primarily through two methods: Wellsâ€“Riley and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. This effort provides a detailed comparison of the two methods for a classroom scenario with masked habitants and various ventilation conditions."
