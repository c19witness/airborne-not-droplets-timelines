# What is GitHub?

Welcome to a bedrock of the software development industry. FOR US, GitHub is the portal WE use for editing and hosting 
of the generated website. Editing these TEXT entries of events requires you to first create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/signup) 
and log into it. Contributions are placed in an area for review called "Pull Requests". Others will complete them from 
there. If so, your changes go live in about one minute after someone reviews then accepts your proposed changes. They 
may of course suggests changes on the comments on a "pull request" (see below). If they do, please consider any 
suggested actions. It could be they accept your contribution them immediately make small changes themselves - that's OK.

## Self setup for making changes on GitHub

First, Make an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com). Please use a real name or something that passes for it: SamWilliams1234. 
Pick 'free' option when it comes up rather that one of the monthly-fee options.

### Making a change to a page

Find the page you want to change, click the "Edit this page" link at the bottom,

Next, you'll see a page on GitHub that suggests you "fork" the repository that hold the site source code, and you'd click 
it to do so:

|              ![fork_repo_to_change.png](./images/fork_repo_to_change.png)               | 
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| Screen cap of part of a GitHub page showing a "fork repo to change" button that's green |

Now, you're in the editor. You should be familiar with markdown at this stage, and the rules of THIS page. Make your 
changes

When you're ready, click "Commit changes" towards the top of the page on the right:

|                 ![commit.png](./images/commit.png)                  | 
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| Screen cap of part of a GitHub page showing a "button" button that's green |

You should pick a nice vert short communicative summary of the change you're trying to propose:

|                      ![propose-changes.png](./images/propose-changes.png)                      | 
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| GitHub page screen cap showing a green "propose changes" button and a text dialog |


Then hit that green "Propose changes" button.

On the next "comparing changes" page hit the "create pull request" button - green on the right hand side

Finally, on a "Open a pull request" page, hit "create pull request" again - green and at the bottom of the page

Now the change you propose will be considered by the team maintaining the site. Watch out for emails - you might get 
pulled into a conversation on the change.
