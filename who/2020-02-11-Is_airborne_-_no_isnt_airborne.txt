text_headline: Is airborne - no isn't airborne
text_text: [BOO] In a double act, Dr Tedros says "it is airborne", Dr Ryan flinches, writes on his paper pad, shows Dr Tedros while underlining something a few times. Dr Tedros then walks the "it is airborne" statement back. This was three days after China CDC said it was airborne (see <a href='https://its-airborne.org/covid19-timeline.html#event-novel-coronavirus-can-transmit-via-aerosol'>other timeline</a>). There is a transcript in the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd2QoYt5Fcw'>official Youtube video</a>. Relevant minute markers are <a href='https://youtu.be/hd2QoYt5Fcw?t=2429'>40.29 (the disclosure)</a>, <a href='https://youtu.be/hd2QoYt5Fcw?t=2521'>42.00 (the whispered instruction)</a> and <a href='https://youtu.be/hd2QoYt5Fcw?t=2779'>46.20 (the retraction)</a>
