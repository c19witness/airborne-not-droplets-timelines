text_headline: WHO's Dr van Kerkhove talks up masks in a tweet
text_text: [YAY]: In <a href='https://x.com/mvankerkhove/status/1741004975625384164'>a tweet </a>,  Dr Maria Van Kerkhove suggests masks, ventilation, testing, treatment, and vaccination. She leaves off 'hand washing' because it won't stop you catching C19. Good job
